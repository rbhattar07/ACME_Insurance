We can make the following observations from the histogram showing smokers and their relation to charges:

For most customers, the annual medical charges are under $10,000. Only a small fraction of customer have higher medical expenses, possibly due to accidents, major illnesses and genetic diseases. The distribution follows a "power law"
There is a significant difference in medical expenses between smokers and non-smokers. While the median for non-smokers is $7300, the median for smokers is close to $35,000.
